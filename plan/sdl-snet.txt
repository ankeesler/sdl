    - MAC PROTOCOL: sequence numbering
    - MAC PROTOCOL: data packets
    - PHY INTERFACE: received ISR
    - SDL LOG TX: Put logging back in
    - SDL LOG RX: test with parent alert signal
    - PHY INTERFACE: transmit (this is done in junction with SNET development)
    - SNET INTERFACE: add a way for users to define their own commands
      - Buttons...
    - MAC PROTOCOL: packet filtering
