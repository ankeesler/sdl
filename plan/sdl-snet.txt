# Plan for future of SNET/SDL integration.

GOALS:
  - 1 test, two nodes, able to command then from script.
  - Port logging to SNET layer.

MILESTONES:
  - Command API = a way for users to define their own commands.
    - I need this so that I can use it in tests.
  - 1 client sends command to server, the server sends command back.
  - MAC packet filtering.
    - Interface ids become the process ID, unless there are multiple threads.
  - MAC packet sequence numbering.
  - MAC packet types.
    - Commands, data.
    
# NWK
#      interface upwards sdlTransmit(length, data) sdlReceive(*length, data)
#    /
# SDL  - network Q for received messages
#    \
#      interface downwards sdlRadioReceivedIsr(fd)
#
#      interfaces upwards sdlPhyTransmit(length, data)
#     /
# SNET

LONGTERM:
  - The sdlTransmit() API has one higher layer API where dest address can be provided.
