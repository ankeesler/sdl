# Plan for future of SNET/SDL integration.

GOALS:
  - 1 test, two nodes, able to command then from script.
  - Port logging to PHY.

MILESTONES:
  DONE:
    - MAC INTERFACE: init, address, transmit, receive
    - MAC PROTOCOL: sequence numbering
    - MAC PROTOCOL: data packets
    - PHY INTERFACE: received ISR
  TODO:
    - SDL LOG: Put logging back in
    - PHY INTERFACE: transmit (this is done in junction with SNET development)
    - SNET INTERFACE: add a way for users to define their own commands
  BACKLOG:
    - MAC PROTOCOL: packet filtering
    - MAC PROTOCOL: command packets
